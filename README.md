# Propagation Networks Implementation

This project is an implementation of the propagation networks computation model described in the MIT thesis ["Propagation Networks: A Flexible and Expressive Substrate for Computation"](https://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/54635/603543210-MIT.pdf) by Alexey Radul.

This is a work in progress.

## Overview

Propagation networks implemented in python. 

## Open Questions 
-How do we handle contradictions in the long term?
-How should we handle constants in cells that should not change? Should we at all? (Sparked by div by 0 error)
-How do we graph these networks?
